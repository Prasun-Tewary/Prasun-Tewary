          Durga Puja, also known as <em>Sharodotsav</em>, is an annual festival originating in the Indian subcontinent
          which reveres and pays homage to the Hindu goddess Durga, and is also celebrated because of Durga's victory
          over Mahishasura.It is particularly celebrated in Bengal, Assam, and other eastern Indian states.The festival
          is observed in the Indian calendar in the month of Ashvin, which corresponds to September–October in the
          Gregorian calendar. Durga Puja is a ten-day festival, of which the last five are of the most significance. The
          puja is performed in homes and public, the latter featuring a temporary stage and structural decorations
          (known as pandals). The festival is also marked by scripture recitations, performance arts, revelry,
          gift-giving, family visits, feasting, and public processions called a melā. Durga Puja in Kolkata has been
          inscribed on the intangible cultural heritage list of UNESCO in December 2021.

          Durga Puja directly affects the economy. In 2022, the economy of West Bengal was estimated to get a boost of
          50,000 crore rupees. The annual GDP of West Bengal was expected to be expanded by 20-30 percent that year. The
          factors responsible for this economic boost are mainly the increase of earning in transport, tourism,
          industry, business, shopping and other fields. The Kolkata Metro Railway recorded an earning of ₹6 crore in
          just five days of Durga Puja in 2022.
